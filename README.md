Hyperspace is a client for Mastodon and the fediverse written in ReactJS. It aims to provide a clean, simple, and fun interface for interacting with Mastodon instances.

## Building from source

To get the packages and environment set up, run `npm install`. Most commands and scripts derive from `create-react-app` and should be easy enough to use.
